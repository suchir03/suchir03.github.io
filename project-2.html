            <h3>Aim of the Project</h3>
            <p>The project aims to evaluate Kowen region of Australian Capital Territory (ACT) to develop residential cluster aligned with ACTâ€™s infrastructure plan 2011-2021. The Kowen region is the northern east part of ACT, and the study site encompasses the Queanbeyan town in the west. It spans approximately 516km<sup>2</sup>. Molonglo river cuts across the study area. </p>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>The report is designed and generated for a hypothetical industry to provide a proposal to the ACT government. The residential cluster development is evaluated based on the following factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Passive solar design for buildings</li>
                <li>Agricultural land-use options in the region</li>
                <li>Forestry for commercial value</li>
                <li>Conservation of biodiversity</li>
                <li>Floods and fire risk</li>
                <li>Maximise financial return on the project for Sunshine Industries</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Kowen region has varied topography and consists of forests, vegetation types, indigenous significance sites, river, streams, and agricultural lands and nearby Queanbeyan town. Hence, GIS analysis is performed considering various factors, models and land-uses. The study sight is classified for following land uses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Building infrastructure</li>
                <li>Conservation of biodiversity</li>
                <li>Agriculture</li>
                <li>Economic value from forestry</li>
                <li>Site of indigenous significance</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>The study is based on multi-criterion evaluation of land-use using various core datasets and the results are discussed in the context of financial viability of infrastructure development. Following data sets are used in Land-use planning - Landsat Imagery, SRTM derived DEM, OpenStreetMap Data, ASDST, Soil Landscape, State boundary of ACT.</p>
            <p>The evaluation based on Multi-Objective Land Allocation suggests that: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>44% of the area is to be conserved to maintain biodiversity</li>
                <li>30% of the area can be used for infrastructure development</li>
                <li>12% of the area to be used for agriculture</li>
                <li>13% of the area for commercial use of forestry</li>
                <li>1% to be conserved for indigenous significance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The southern and eastern region of the study area is most suitable for infrastructure development. The area covering the mountainous terrain and most of the northwestern part is to be conserved.</p>
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>The results provided should be interpreted as exploratory and some of the limitations of the project include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Various factors affecting building suitability and agriculture like erosion are not considered</li>
                <li>Systematic errors in core data sets are not considered</li>
                <li>Artefacts persist after filtering incorrect stream locations</li>
            </ul>
