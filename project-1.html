        <h1>Lake Mungo - Time Series Analysis </h1>
        <article>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Lake Mungo is a dry lake in the semi-arid environment of southeast Australia located in New South Wales (NSW). This region contains some of the earliest evidence of Homo sapiens  of Africa, establishing that humans had dispersed as far as Australia by 42,000 years ago. Lake Mungo is a site of great importance in the world of archaeology as it holds a fascinating history of quaternary climate change and early human interaction with Australian ecology. Until recently, before the findings of <a href='https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/childs-grave-is-the-oldest-human-burial-found-in-africa'>child’s burial found in Africa</a>, Lake Mungo is best known for its world's first human burial and first recorded cremation, famously known as Mungo Man (Mungo I) and Mungo Woman (Mungo III). The lake is dried out since 19,000 - 22,000 years and the environmental conditions since then has created beautiful crescent shaped sand dunes on the eastern banks of the lake.</p>
            <h3>A prelude to the Research</h3>
            <p>A series of crescent-shaped sand dunes called lunettes developed over tens of thousands of years have eroded significantly in the recent past and have exposed various archaeological artefacts, allowing scientists and researchers to find archaeological artefacts and interpret human environmental interactions. The erosion poses a threat in conserving the history of indigenous Australians. Hence, recording and protecting this famous archaeologically significant site will be an educational asset, economically valuable in tourism and help in understanding the changing landscape of Lake Mungo.</p>
            <p>After doing extensive literature survey, for this research thestructure from motion technique (SfM-MVS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is employed to build a 2.5D digital elevation model and carry out spatiotemporal analysis for the Joulni site at Lake Mungo.</p>
            <p>The research is aimed to quantify the extent and the rate of denudation of Joulni, Lake Mungo, a World Heritage site in New South Wales, Australia by making use of SfM-MVS techniques coupled with change detection algorithms and images derived from UAV.</p>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>Topographic surveying is carried out from 2015 to 2018 using SenseFly eBee RTK UAV integrated with GPS receiver and Sony WX220 camera. The fixed wing aircraft took approximately 1000 overlapping images for each survey year,  a process to create a 3D point cloud model using SfM-MVS techniques. In this research, both Agisoft Photoscan and Pix4D software packages were used to create the 3D model. A comparison of various software packages is done and covered in the research thesis.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>A high-resolution (0.05m) 2.5-dimensional Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is generated from the three-dimensional point cloud data. ArcGIS and Global Mapper is used extensively to handle point cloud data and generate the required DEM using standard Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) algorithm. To achieve higher accuracy the errors resulting from camera images are filtered using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). LiDAR and SfM-MVS derived DEMs are also compared with each other in this study.</p>
            <p>Finally, each interval of the epochs over the three years is differenced using DoD, LS3D and ArcGIS algorithms and the resulting elevation changes are used to analyse the erosion and deposition of sediments at Joulni section of Lake Mungo.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The study shows that some regions of the lunettes having high denudation or aggregation have reliable estimates. However, changes less than ±16cm is hard to determine and quantify. With careful elevation modelling and consideration of spatial errors, SfM-MVS can successfully be used as a low-cost method in topographic surveying in comparison to LiDAR.</p>
